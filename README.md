<p>
I am passionate about cybersecurity, cloud operations, and identity management. I enjoy building <b>real-world, enterprise-style projects</b> that demonstrate security, monitoring, automation, and access control in cloud environments. My goal is to bridge <b>cloud engineering</b> with <b>cybersecurity and identity best practices</b>.
